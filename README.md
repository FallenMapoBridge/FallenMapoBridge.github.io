## Abstract
VISQUIT is order service powered by voice recognition technology based on artificial intelligence. Nowadays, many stores adopt using KIOSK system, by which the cost of hiring clerks and the time spent to make an individual order reduce. However, the problem is that installing the kiosk is still expensive.
To solve this cost problem we suggest to use NUGU speaker, voice recognition technology. With NUGU speaker, customer can order with voice.  If the system can understand one's speech and make conversation with each other, this can effectively replace the previous "man-provided" ordering system. And furthermore, the KIOSK's cost-burden problem will be resolved.
We will heavily rely on SKTelecom's NUGU Platform to implement voice recognition feature. We will develop UI with React.js library, compose backend structure with Node.js, and build CI/CD infrastructure with Docker and Jenkins.

## User Interface for Client
We provide the client with a function of menu management and order checking.
